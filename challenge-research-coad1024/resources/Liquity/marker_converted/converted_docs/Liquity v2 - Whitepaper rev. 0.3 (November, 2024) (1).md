## Abstract


Liquity V2 improves on the pioneering achievements of Liquity V1 by introducing a more
capital efficient borrowing protocol that offers user-set interest rates and the ability to borrow
against multiple collateral assets.


Liquity V2 will support ETH as well as leading liquid staking tokens (LSTs) –Lido wrapped
staked ETH, and Rocket Pool staked ETH– as collateral, and introduces a new stablecoin

named BOLD. BOLD will be native to Ethereum and have minimal centralized collateral

risks.


1 DISCLAIMER: The outlined ideas for the Liquity Protocol V2 are for informational purposes only. The
scope and implementation may change and should not be relied upon. Note that whenever the term
Liquity is used, it refers to the protocol in the version V1 or V2, not the company Liquity AG.


BOLD inherits the resilience of LUSD, while also benefiting from improved peg dynamics
and sustainable real yield. Peg stability and demand for the stablecoin are ensured by
diverting the entirety of the protocol’s revenues towards the Stability Pool and protocol
incentivized liquidity (PIL) or similar incentives. By minting BOLD, users can gain instant
liquidity or leverage, while managing their own borrowing costs relative to market conditions.


In addition to introducing dynamic interest rates, Liquity V2 also welcomes a novel adaptive
redemption mechanism around it, which helps facilitate a dynamic market between
borrowers and stability seekers without the need for active governance.


With minimal governance, and the core components of the system being immutable, Liquity
V2 continues to prioritize security, decentralization, and user autonomy.

## Introduction and motivation


In April 2021, Liquity introduced the world’s first fully decentralized stablecoin that runs
autonomously without human governance. With its attractive borrowing product allowing an
LTV of up to 90.9%, Liquity V1 has successfully issued over $4.75b in loans against ETH by
minting its own stablecoin, LUSD. In addition to pushing the boundaries of capital efficiency
and decentralization, Liquity has brought interest-free loans to the DeFi space, catering to

the zero interest environment of the time.


Liquity V1 also pioneered the first CDP system with a built-in redemption mechanism to
create a stablecoin with a strong downward peg protection with no dependency on
centralized collateral. The redemption feature allows _any_ LUSD holder to exchange their
stablecoins for $1 worth of ETH. When LUSD is below peg, users can buy it for e.g. $0.99 off
the market and sell to the protocol for $1.00 worth of collateral (see [blog post).](https://www.liquity.org/blog/understanding-liquitys-redemption-mechanism)


This mechanism maintains a hard price floor around $1 through direct arbitrage, and is key
for LUSD’s reputation as the most resilient stablecoin; many existing stablecoins have
suffered from downward peg deviations due to high sell pressure.


On the flipside, redemptions in Liquity V1 impact the riskiest borrowers as the redeemed
LUSD is used to pay back the loans with the lowest collateral ratio in exchange for an
equivalent amount of ETH. The affected borrowers see their collateral and debt go down
equally, implying no net loss but a reduced exposure to ETH.


Since the launch of Liquity V1, the macroeconomic situation and the interest rate
environment in DeFi have changed drastically. Due to the skyrocketing market rates for
stablecoins and a lack of a competitive yield source, LUSD has been subject to high sell
pressure and soaring redemption volumes. Liquity V1 borrowers reacted by increasing their
collateral ratios to previously unseen levels, just to avoid redemptions. This has seriously
impaired Liquity V1’s ability to provide capital-efficient loans.


Being interest-free in nature and with its fixed-cost reward system, Liquity V1 has shown to
work reliably in low interest environments, and it continues to be a viable option for


1


borrowers in such scenarios. But in high interest rate situations, users tend to seek
stablecoins with higher yields.


To handle such market fluctuations effectively, Liquity V2 innovates by introducing user-set
interest rates: the borrowers can choose their own interest rate, whatever they are willing to
pay! Through user-set interest rates, redemptions can be neatly married with dynamic
interest rates. Instead of targeting the loans with the lowest collateral ratio, redemptions will
now be performed in ascending order of individual interest rates. Borrowers with low interest
rates thus have the highest risk of being affected by redemptions. Users can freely manage
their redemption risk by adjusting their interest rates relative to their peers (or delegate the
management to third parties). Offering recurring interest rates, V2 is also more attractive to
short-term borrowers than Liquity V1 with its upfront loan origination fees.


Based on the borrowers’ individual risk tolerance, the market will establish a range of
individual interest rates. Borrowers willing to risk redemptions may set below-average rates
for capital efficiency, whereas more risk averse or “set-and-forget” borrowers may opt for an
above-average rate for peace of mind. Thus, the system handles borrowing volumes in a
more adaptive way while allowing the protocol to earn a variable interest revenue on a
continuous basis. The protocol can thus achieve flexible interest rates purely through market
forces without relying on governance or algorithmically controlled interest rates.


In contrast to Liquity V1 which only accepts ETH as collateral, Liquity V2 will further tap into
a larger market by enabling users to borrow against ETH as well as several LSTs like e.g.
Lido's wstETH. LSTs allow users to earn staking rewards on their staked assets while
maintaining liquidity and have become increasingly popular as collateral in DeFi projects,
including some of Liquity’s forks.


Due to Liquity V1’s non-upgradeability, Liquity V2 will be a separate protocol issuing a new
stablecoin, called BOLD, which inherits LUSD’s most admired characteristics. BOLD will be
safe, decentralized, unstoppable and directly redeemable. Beyond that, BOLD will benefit
from improved peg dynamics and protocol-incentivized liquidity (PIL) on secondary markets.


Building upon Liquity V1’s proven achievements, Liquity V2 makes use of Stability Pools
(one for every collateral) as its primary mechanism to liquidate undercollateralized loans with
no detrimental price impact on the stablecoin. The interest payments will act as a
sustainable real yield source for BOLD depositors and liquidity providers.


These improvements make Liquity V2 fundamentally incentive aligned: the more you are
willing to pay as a borrower, the more revenue you contribute to drive demand, stability and
liquidity for BOLD as a stablecoin. User-set interest rates enable a capital efficient
equilibrium between BOLD borrowers and holders in a fully market-driven manner.
Borrowers can thus effectively benefit from Liquity V2’s attractive loan to value (LTV) ratios
which don’t impact their redemption risk.


When the demand for ETH-based loans or leverage is low and the demand for stability high,
Liquity V2 enables loans for as low as 0.5% p.a. On the contrary, when demand for leverage
is high, the protocol will offer ETH-loans at competitive market rates with attractive LTV


2


ratios. With that, Liquity V2 offers a vastly improved borrowing experience, catering to a
larger market while adhering to the high security standards known from Liquity V1.

## Competitive landscape


The stablecoin landscape has evolved substantially in the 3 years since the launch of Liquity
V1. While MakerDAO and its DAI stablecoin have drifted away from using only decentralized
collateral by incorporating centralized stablecoins and real-world assets as backing,
newcomers and established protocols alike have entered the scene with their own

stablecoins.


In 2023, Curve Finance introduced crvUSD, a stablecoin managed by algorithmic borrow
rates and an autonomous peg-keeping mechanism, using Curve pools as collateral. Despite
innovating on multiple fronts including soft-liquidations of borrowing positions, crvUSD
doesn’t have an efficient interest rate market between borrowers and stablecoin holders, but
relies on manual incentives to obtain liquidity. Curve has experienced extremely volatile
borrow rates, exceeding 50% at times.


Following a more traditional model, Aave’s GHO stablecoin can be borrowed against a host

- f collateral assets with the terms being subject to human governance. After an initial period

- f peg issues, Aave introduced a yield source for GHO depositors, eventually stabilizing its
price. Ethena is pursuing the idea of delta-neutral stablecoins by partnering with centralized
exchanges offering perpetual futures and requiring custodians to manage the collateral.
Other entrants in the centralized stablecoin space like Mountain have introduced
yield-bearing stablecoins, kicking back the yield earned by their reserves to stablecoin
holders. It is yet to be seen how that will affect established actors such as Circle and Tether
in the long run.


In contrast to most of its competitors, BOLD is a resilient stablecoin by design:

  -  - nly backed by crypto assets (no real world assets or custody by centralized players)

  - not subject to collateral changes and protocol upgrades (immutable)

  - directly redeemable (always convertible in a fast and liquid way)


A successful stablecoin should not only be unstoppable and decentralized, but flexible
enough to adapt to changing market environments like rising or falling interest rates.
Furthermore, it should have utility as a store of value and unit of exchange. A stablecoin can

- nly thrive if there’s sufficient demand for holding and transacting with it. In times of positive
interest rates, this may imply a need for a continuous yield source for the stablecoin.


Existing stablecoins face challenges with regard to the efficiency, decentralization and/or
sustainability of their yield sources. To date no existing solution has established an efficient
interest-rate market between borrowers and stablecoin holders. Current protocols either rely

- n slow and potentially misaligned human governance to adjust interest rates (DAI, GHO), or
they don’t have a targeted way of using interest payments to drive demand for their
stablecoin (crvUSD). Liquity V2 will change that. It is designed to strike an optimal balance
between borrowers and stability seekers by flexibly adapting to the macroeconomic situation
in a fully market-driven way.

**Management and distribution of borrowing interest in different protocols:**

## Key benefits and innovations


Liquity V2 offers a plethora of benefits and innovations:


   Multiple LSTs as collateral

   More attractive short-term borrowing

   User-set interest rates with delegation facility

   Sustainable real yield

   Improved peg dynamics

   More capital efficient: minimum collateral ratio of 110 % and no Recovery Mode

   Instant leverage

   Separate borrow markets and collateral risk alignment

   Improved redemption mechanics

   Protocol-incentivized liquidity (PIL)

   Peripheral governance with time-based voting power

   Multiple and transferable Troves per address

### Multiple LSTs as collateral


Besides ETH, Liquity V2 will support Lido wrapped staked ETH (wstETH) and Rocket Pool
staked ETH (rETH) as collateral. Borrowers can thus get liquidity or leverage while benefiting
from auto-compounding staking yields.


4


In contrast to most other Liquity forks with LST collaterals, V2 will represent each LST as a
separate borrow market with its own interest rates and risk parameters. In this setup the risk
for each LST will be reflected individually through the ratio between the debt collateralized by
the LST and the size of the corresponding Stability Pool (SP). This enables the protocol to
manage collateral risks in an autonomous way by directing BOLD redemptions mostly
towards LSTs with lower SP backing in order to reduce the exposure to the corresponding
LST. As with the user-determined interest rates, V2 is relying on market-driven mechanisms
to manage and reduce the risk in the system.

### More attractive short-term borrowing


With its vastly reduced upfront costs, Liquity V2 is inherently more attractive to short-term
borrowers and leverage seekers. Borrowers will be paying an interest rate for the duration [2]

- f their loans, benefiting from greater flexibility in time.

### User-set interest rates with delegation facility


Liquity V2’s main innovation lies in its unique market-driven interest rate mechanism:
borrowers may choose the rate they are willing to pay for their debts between 0.5% and
250%. While borrowers can freely set and adapt their individual interest rates, they are
expected to manage their rates in line with the market to avoid redemptions.


The redemption mechanism allows any holder to swap BOLD for $1 worth of collateral (such
as ETH and LSTs), enabling arbitrage whenever BOLD is trading below peg. The collateral
paid to the redeemer is taken from the borrower who is paying the currently lowest interest
rate [3], in return for an equivalent reduction of their debt. Borrowers affected by redemptions
lose exposure to their collateral even if they don’t incur a financial loss at that moment. They
are thus incentivized to keep their redemption risk low by paying sufficiently high interest
rates compared to their peers.


As the interest payments by borrowers determine the yield achievable on BOLD, the interest
rates help stabilize the peg and redemption volumes under changing market conditions:
when borrowers increase their rates to minimize redemption risk, it becomes more attractive
to deposit BOLD to earn a share of the borrowers’ interest payments. Higher interest rates
thus result in a higher stablecoin yield, supporting BOLD’s price when below peg and
curtailing redemptions. Vice versa, when BOLD is above peg and the redemption risk is low,
borrowers may safely reduce their rates, decreasing the stablecoin demand and its price.


Borrowers and Stability Pool depositors (aka ’Earners’) will thus act as the two sides of a
dynamic interest rate market, obviating the need for controllers or human governance to
manage a global interest rate. Liquity V2 behaves similarly to money markets but with

- pposite spreads: depending on the utilization and integration of the stablecoin in broader
DeFi, the Stability Pool yields may even exceed the average interest rates, something that


2 See below “Interest rate adjustment and premature adjustment fee” regarding the fee charged on

- verly frequent interest rate adjustments.

3 For the given collateral. See below.


5


isn’t possible on money markets where borrowers always pay higher rates [4] than what the

lenders receive.


This yield amplification increases with the number of external use cases and utility for BOLD,
by reducing the fraction of BOLD in the Stability Pool. An increasing demand for BOLD puts
upward pressure on the peg, lowering the probability of redemptions. When redemptions are
less likely, borrowers may lower their rates and get more attractive conditions. Liquity V2
should therefore benefit from decreasing interest rates the more it gets established in the
broader DeFi ecosystem.


We anticipate that borrowers will need to adjust their interest rates on a regular basis to
manage their redemption risk and optimize their borrowing costs. As this may not be suitable
for every borrower, the system offers a convenient, safe and gas-efficient way to delegate
the management of the interest rate to third parties.


The efficiency gain is due to a batching mechanism which allows the chosen delegate to
adjust the interest rates of multiple borrowers at once in the same transaction. We expect
that professional batch delegates will offer their services to Liquity V2 borrowers.

### Sustainable real yield


As opposed to Liquity and most of its forks, Liquity V2 comes with a sustainable real-yield
source in the form of continuous interest payments (in BOLD) by borrowers to Stability Pool
depositors (Earners) and other recipients such as liquidity providers. This will ensure a base
holding-demand for BOLD in the long run.


4 Disregarding the yield earned on the collateral, which in case of LSTs is close to 0%.

### Improved peg dynamics

Liquity V2 employs a market driven monetary policy through user-set interest rates which
can dynamically react to situations where BOLD is above or below $1 [5] .


As the interest rate paid by borrowers serves as direct revenue for the BOLD stablecoin
within the Stability Pool, it also has an impact on the stablecoin demand. When BOLD trades
above $1, borrowers will tend to reduce their rates due to the lower redemption risk. This
makes borrowing more and holding BOLD less attractive.
Conversely, when BOLD is below $1, borrowers are exposed to a higher redemption risk and
are likely to increase their rates. Borrowing thus becomes less attractive, while demand for
BOLD should increase, pushing its price upward.

### More capital efficient


Liquity V2 increases capital efficiency in high interest environments as the redemption risk
can be managed by adjusting the interest rate rather than lowering the LTV of a Trove. While
Liquity V1 has experienced very high collateral ratios due to excessive redemption risk in
such scenarios, Liquity V2 will enable capital efficient borrowing in all market situations.


Furthermore, Liquity V2 does away with the Recovery Mode known from Liquity V1,
simplifying the liquidation logic and offering an effective minimum collateral ratio of 110% or


5 In Liquity V1, the borrowing costs are fixed, whereas the LQTY emissions for holding LUSD in the
Stability Pool keep streaming regardless of LUSD’s price, though tapering off over time. There are no
specific mechanisms in place to encourage the release of LUSD from the Stability Pool when LUSD is
above $1.


7


an LTV of 90.91% for ETH and 83.33% for wstETH and rETH. Borrowers don’t have to worry
about being liquidated at higher ratios if the system’s total collateralization drops too low [6] .

### Instant leverage


Liquity V2 allows users to enter a leveraged position in one transaction by using external
flash loans and swapping the borrowed BOLD back using the incentivized liquidity pools.
Users can thus achieve the desired leverage ratio in a predictable and cost-effective way
without having to manually loop and swap the borrowed amounts, reducing gas costs and
unforeseen losses due to slippage.

### Separate borrow markets and collateral risk alignment


Each supported collateral asset constitutes an individual _borrow market_ with its own group of
borrowers and a separate Stability Pool (SP) backing their debts in return for a share of their
interest payments. For example, stability depositors to the SP (ETH) only benefit from the
interest paid by users borrowing against ETH, and receive liquidation gains in ETH
accordingly.


The borrow markets are separated in the following aspects:


   Separate list of borrowers ordered by interest rates (relevant for redemption order)

   Individual Stability Pool (relevant for liquidation)

   Redistribution limited to the list of borrowers (no mixing of collateral among positions)


This separation impacts the user groups in different ways:

   - **Borrowers:** collateral risk is limited to the collateral asset held by the borrower.
Given that collateral assets are never redistributed across different borrow markets, a
borrower isn’t negatively affected by a failure of another collateral asset.

   - **BOLD holders:** as a multi-collateral stablecoin, BOLD is reliant on effective
liquidations of undercollateralized loans in every borrow market to remain

    - vercollateralized. Holders are thus subject to the risks of all supported collateral
assets, facing a potential depegging of BOLD due to failed liquidations and bad debt
in worst case scenarios [7] .

   - **Earners:** in case of a liquidation, SP depositors (Earners) only get exposure to the
asset they have opted for. However, as BOLD holders they are similarly affected from
a potential depegging.


To manage the risks across multiple collateral assets, Liquity V2 incorporates an adaptive
redemption logic, keeping “weaker” collateral assets in check compared to collaterals with
larger SP backing. If only little BOLD is held in a certain SP compared to the outstanding
debt amount for the respective collateral, it signals a lower confidence of the market in this

LST.


6 In Liquity V1 the Recovery Mode is mainly needed due to a lack of sustainable yield for the Stability
Pool, increasing reliance on redistribution for liquidations in the long term. Liquity V2 pays out a real
yield, and aims to keep the Stability Pools backing sufficiently large through its adaptive redemption
logic.

7 In a worst case scenario where a collateral asset suddenly breaks down or loses most of its value,
not all affected borrowers may be liquidated in time.


8


Thus, proportionally more redemptions will be executed against Troves collateralized with
the respective LST (to shrink the exposure of the protocol to this collateral). Along with
emergency measures and a collateral shutdown mechanism, this increases BOLD’s overall
resiliency.


The segregated borrow markets and the redemption mechanic not only aim to align the risks
across the LSTs with their different risk profiles and qualities (e.g. available liquidity), but
allow each borrow market to establish its own range of interest rates [8] . Borrow markets may
thus achieve competitive rates for every collateral asset with regard to the broader DeFi

market.

### Improved redemption mechanics


The market-driven interest rate mechanism and its positive effect on stablecoin demand
aims to reduce redemption volumes overall compared to Liquity V1 where redemptions are

based on the borrowers’ collateral ratios.


To mitigate potential losses for borrowers hit by redemptions, the redemption fee charged to
the redeemer remains inside the affected Troves rather than being diverted as in Liquity V1.
In other words, affected borrowers essentially benefit from a better BOLD:USD exchange
due to the applicable fee.

### Protocol-incentivized liquidity (PIL)


Having sufficient liquidity on DEXes is important especially for new stablecoins. Liquity V2
diverts on the protocol level 25% of the interest revenue from all borrow markets to various
liquidity initiatives, based on a split determined through weekly gauge voting. With its
sustainable Protocol Liquidity Incentives, we expect 10% of the BOLD supply to be available
as liquidity across multiple AMMs like Curve or Uniswap.

### Peripheral governance with time-base voting power


Liquity V2 is subject to minimal governance which is solely tasked with distributing the
available liquidity incentives between the available DEX pairs through gauge voting.
Governance has no other functions or powers as Liquity V2’s smart contracts are immutable
and not upgradeable. This ensures V2 users will benefit from the same predictability as in
V1. Terms and conditions are set in stone, and are thus not subject to governance and
potential take-overs.


The BOLD stablecoin is an ERC-20 token exclusively minted through borrowing and burned
when repaid or redeemed or in case of liquidation. Like LUSD, BOLD is unstoppable, market
driven and managed autonomously by a non-upgradeable protocol.


8 Borrowing markets with less risky or higher quality collateral assets are likely to have lower interest
rates than lower quality assets.


9


Being immutable yet adaptable, Liquity V2 has a peripheral governance mechanism in
charge of managing 25% of interest revenue from borrowing. Despite its limited scope, the
mechanism comes with a number of innovations to align incentives, while making voting

attractive and efficient.


Liquidity incentives accrue in BOLD and are then distributed on a weekly cadence across
any number of eligible initiatives, or target addresses. Their distribution is a function of
gauge weighting: users with voting power can propose, weigh and veto initiatives as they

see fit.


Users accumulate voting power for protocol liquidity incentives by staking the LQTY token,
without any locking mechanism. The voting power is proportional to the amount staked and
the time passed since staking:


**Voting Power = LQTY Staked × (Average** [9] **) Staking Age**


The above chart shows the individual voting power of four users A, B, C and D that have
staked the same amount at different times. By dividing their individual voting power by the
total voting power, the protocol derives the relative voting power distribution:


9 If the user changes their stake later on (e.g. by staking more LQTY or unstaking a part of it), the
protocol uses a time-weighted average to determine the stake’s voting power.


10


The longer a user stakes, the more voting power they risk losing if they decide to unstake.
Over time, defection becomes increasingly costly, effectively binding stakers to the protocol
and aligning their incentives without imposing the opportunity costs associated with
traditional locking or vote escrow mechanisms.


As V2 stakers also keep earning the LUSD and ETH rewards from V1, staking in V2
presents a unique dual-reward opportunity at no extra cost.

## Functionality and use cases


The system overview diagram below provides a clear illustration of Liquity V2’s internal
mechanics, and how its components seamlessly integrate and function together:


11


### Borrowing

##### Open Trove

A user can open a Trove by depositing an eligible collateral asset [10] and borrow BOLD up to
an LTV of 90.91% (for ETH [11] ) or 83.33% (for wstETH and rETH), implying a minimum
collateral ratio of 110% or 120% respectively [12] .


The system requires an additional deposit of 0.0375 ETH regardless of the chosen collateral,
which is set aside to cover the gas costs of a potential liquidation.


Importantly, the user needs to set an initial interest rate within a range of 0.5% and 250%.
While the interest increases the borrower’s debt over time, it is charged upfront for the first 7
days upon opening (see the section below).


As an alternative to setting their own interest rates, borrowers may delegate interest rate
management to a third party by selecting the delegate’s address instead (see below “Interest
rate delegation”).


Upon borrowing, the protocol mints the requested BOLD amount minus a small opening fee
(see section below) and transfers it to the borrower’s Ethereum address. The borrower is
free to use and spend the BOLD to their liking.


10 The collateral assets are hardcoded and not subject to governance.

11 The provided ETH gets seamlessly wrapped into WETH and unwrapped upon withdrawal.

12 The system further requires a minimum debt of 2000 BOLD amount to open a position, making sure
that redemptions remain gas-efficient.


12


The Troves itself are represented as NFTs and can be freely transferred to other Ethereum
addresses. The same address can thus hold multiple Troves.

##### Interest rate adjustment and premature adjustment fee


Borrowers are free to adjust their interest rates whenever they want. However, the borrower
has to pay a premature adjustment fee if the adjustment happens within less than 7 days
since the last adjustment [13] . The fee is equal to 7 days of average interest on the respective
collateral branch [14] . It is charged in BOLD and is added to the Trove's debt. The same fee is
charged when a new Trove is opened or when its debt is increased.


This premature adjustment fee aims to impede Trove reopening and redemption evasion
strategies where borrowers try to minimise their interest payments in an unfair manner [15] .

##### Liquidation


Borrowers are required to keep their Troves sufficiently collateralized at all times. A Trove
whose LTV exceeds the respective liquidation threshold (maximum LTV) is subject to
liquidation [16] .


A liquidated Trove loses its entire outstanding debt and most of its collateral, usually
amounting to 105% of the liquidated debt. Any remaining collateral after deduction of this
liquidation penalty (5%) can be claimed by the liquidated borrower (except in case of a
redistribution as explained below).


Liquidations take place inside the borrow market of the liquidated collateral asset. Each
collateral has its own liquidation threshold, Stability Pool and a separate redistribution
procedure affecting only borrowers whose debt is backed by the same collateral as the
liquidated position.


The liquidation is performed in the following order of priority (e.g. for ETH):


13 The opening of the position and the delegation of rate management to a batch manager are treated
the same way as an interest rate adjustment.

14 Example: if the average interest rate of a collateral branch is 5%, the borrower has to pay a fee of
0.096% on each adjustment.

15 Savvy users could anticipate upcoming redemptions (including via watching the mempool) and
temporarily move their Trove’s interest rate up to avoid redemption, allowing redemptions to hit
another user, and then moving their interest back down shortly after.

16 Liquidation is a permissionless function that can be called by anybody.


13


**(1) Stability Pool contains BOLD:** an amount of BOLD corresponding to the borrower’s

debt is burned from the SP (ETH), while 105% of the nominal debt value [17] is taken
from the borrower’s collateral (ETH) and given to the SP (ETH). The affected SP
depositors receive debt and collateral shares in proportion to their current BOLD
deposits.


If the Stability Pool doesn’t cover the full entire debt and gets completely emptied by
the liquidation, the system falls back to the following liquidations modes.


**(2) Stability Pool is empty:** the liquidator can freely choose between two fallback

liquidation modes for the debt exceeding the funds in the SP:


**(2a) Just-in-time (JIT) liquidation:** the liquidator deposits an amount of
BOLD corresponding to the (remaining) debt to the Stability Pool and
immediately triggers its liquidation in exchange for 105% of its nominal value
in ETH [18] .


        **(2b) Redistribution:** the liquidator triggers a redistribution, through which the
Trove’s entire debt and collateral (ETH) is redistributed to all fellow borrowers
with ETH collateral, in proportion to their own collateral amounts. Thus, the
respective borrowers will receive a share of the liquidated collateral and see
their debts increase proportionally.


As long as the liquidation is triggered slightly above the maximum LTV (e.g. 110% for ETH)
and BOLD isn’t substantially over peg, liquidations will be profitable for all recipients (SP, JIT


17 The protocol treats 1 BOLD as equal to $1. However, the market value of BOLD may be higher than
$1 especially in case of mass liquidations and liquidity crunches, reducing the liquidation gains.

18 The two operations can be combined in a single transaction.


14


liquidator, fellow borrowers). Based on historical data from Liquity V1 [19], liquidations are likely
to be net positive even with a 5% penalty in most cases.


The increased liquidation penalty in case of a redistribution ensures that the Total
Collateralization Ratio (TCR) of the respective borrow market doesn’t drop as a result of the
liquidation.


Liquidation is a permissionless function that can also be called on a batch of multiple
liquidatable Troves at once. The liquidator receives compensation for the effective gas costs
plus a margin.

### Interest rate delegation


The protocol offers two different ways of delegating interest rate management: individual and
batch delegation. In both cases, the elected delegate can only change the interest rate, but

not the borrower’s debt or collateral.


Batch management improves gas efficiency, allowing third parties to offer professional
interest rate management services to borrowers.

##### Individual delegation


A borrower may choose to give interest rate update permissions to an individual delegate
address (e.g. a friend or a hot wallet), setting a maximum and a minimum interest rate. This
address then has only the ability to update the borrower’s interest rate within the given

range.


Individual delegation can be useful for users that go on vacation or institutions that want to
keep their Trove in cold storage but manage rates on a regular basis with a hot wallet.


The borrower can revoke the delegation or update the range any time.

##### Batch delegation


Batch delegates set and update a common interest rate for every Trove in the given batch at
the same time. In contrast to individual delegation, a batch has a range (maximum and
minimum interest rate) and a minimum waiting time between updates [20] preset by the
delegate that can’t be changed afterwards. Upon registration, a batch delegate can also set
a management fee (e.g. 0.05%) that will be charged over time on the debt under
management.


To delegate interest rate management to a batch manager, the borrower has to choose an
address that has been previously registered by the batch delegate. The borrower can revoke
the delegation any time.


19 See the chart at https://dune.com/queries/81466/162640.

20 The waiting time protects the delegating borrowers from a rapid debt increase due to overly
frequent interest rate adjustments leading to excessive premature adjustment fee charges.


15


### Delegation for other actions

Separately from the interest rate delegation, the borrower may give permission to a third
party address (which doesn’t need to be an interest rate delegate) for other interactions with

their Trove.

##### Delegation of debt and collateral management


The delegate gets full permission to manage the debt and collateral of the Trove by adding

- r removing collateral or by borrowing or repaying BOLD. This allows delegates to offer
services such as automated leveraging or deleveraging without requiring the borrower to use
a proxy contract.


The Trove owner can specify a receiver address for the minted BOLD and collateral
withdrawals, which may be different from the manager and the owner, according to their trust
assumptions.

##### Delegation for benevolent actions


With this more restricted delegation, the third party address only gets the permission to
repay the borrower’s debt or add more collateral. This ‘benevolent’ option is available by
default to any Trove owner, and the owner can choose to restrict access to a single specified

address or to the owner’s address itself.


Being trustless due to its beneficial nature, this type of delegation could facilitate novel use
cases like interest rate swaps. For example, the Trove owner ("owner") and third party
("setter") could enter into an external agreement whereby the owner pays a fixed interest
rate to the setter, and in turn the setter sets the rate and pays the prevailing rate of interest
to avoid redemption.

### Stability Pools


Stability Pools act as the first line of defence to absorb liquidations of Troves whose LTV
exceeds the liquidation threshold (see above “Liquidation”). Compared with Liquity V1, each
borrow market (ETH, wstETH and rETH) has its own SP, giving depositors the choice which
collateral they would like exposure to in exchange for yield.


The BOLD contained in the respective SP is used to pay back the liquidated borrower’s debt
in return for collateral, resulting in net liquidation gains up to 5% for the depositors [21] .


Stability depositors (aka “Earners”) in a given borrow market thus receive


   75% of the interest paid by borrowers in BOLD

   Liquidation gains denominated in the respective collateral asset


21 Both the distributed collateral and the burned debt are determined pro rata to the size of the BOLD
deposits.

The following diagram illustrates the working of a single Stability Pool (e.g. for ETH borrow
market), demonstrating the liquidation of a Trove whose LTV exceeds the liquidation

threshold:

##### Deposit and withdrawal


Users may deposit BOLD to an SP at any time and will start receiving the interest payments
from the respective borrow market, while earning a proportional share of the liquidated
collateral in return for the BOLD burned upon liquidations. Deposits can always be
withdrawn unless there is undercollateralized debt in the respective borrow market, in which
case the debt has to be liquidated first [22] .


To compound or realize their yield, depositors can always claim [23] their accumulated interest
and collateral gains.

### Redemption mechanism


The redemption mechanism ensures that BOLD cannot drop below $1 for sustained periods
by allowing _any holder_ to exchange 1 BOLD for $1 worth of collateral.


When BOLD is worth less than $1 minus the current redemption fee, arbitrageurs will have
an incentive to buy and redeem BOLD for profit, pushing its price back to parity and creating
a price floor around $1. As the redeemed BOLD is burned, redemptions reduce the
stablecoin supply in lockstep with market demand.


22 Just as in Liquity V1, this restriction makes it harder for depositors to evade liquidations.

23 Depositors will also have the option between paying out the pending gains when adjusting their
deposits or "stashing” them for a later claim.

While the redemption mechanism fulfils the same purpose as in Liquity V1, it also has a
number of differences with regard to the procedure, the effect on borrowers, the ordering, the
fee, and the collateral split received by the redeemer.

##### Collateral split


In contrast to LUSD, BOLD is backed by a multitude of collaterals. Instead of letting the
redeemer freely choose the collateral to redeem, Liquity V2 optimizes the process for
economic safety. Redemptions are thus serviced through a collateral mix in a way that
enhances the overall backing of BOLD.


Upon confirmation, the protocol first splits the redeemed amount between all borrow
markets, i.e. across the eligible collateral assets.


The split is determined proportional to the "outside" portion of the respective debt, which is
defined as the total debt borrowed against a certain collateral minus the size of the SP of the
respective borrowing market.


Given outside debt amounts of 100 BOLD, 50 BOLD and 100 BOLD respectively as an
example, a redemption will result in a 40% (ETH) - 20% (wstETH) - 40% (rETH) split:

##### Order and effect on individual Troves


Based on the determined collateral split, the redemption is then performed against the
borrowers in all markets concurrently in ascending order of interest rates, starting with the
Trove with the lowest rate. If the redeemed amount exceeds the debt of the currently lowest
rate borrower, the protocol switches to the next higher rate borrower to redeem the
remainder, and so on.


18


The redeemed BOLD is used to repay the debt of Troves in exchange for an equivalent

amount of collateral. The actual amount **c** - f collateral that is taken out from the affected

Trove(s) and given to the redeemer is calculated as follows:


**c = m * pc(t) * (1 - f(t))**


where **m** is the redeemed amount for the respective collateral and Trove, **pc(t)** the oracle
price of the collateral in USD at current time **t**, and **f(t)** the current redemption fee. With that,
the redemption fee is deducted from the withdrawn collateral and remains with the Trove

- wner.

##### Redemption fee


Liquity V2 applies the same formula for determining the redemption fee as Liquity V1, but
with different parameters (larger spike and faster decay). The fee rate **f(t)** is the sum of a
minimum fee **fmin** (= 0.5%) and an exponentially decaying base rate **b(t)** calculated for each
time step **ti** as follows:


**b(ti) = b(ti-1) * β** **[Δt]**


where **β** is a constant decay factor determined to result in a half-life of 6 hours **.**


When a redemption transaction is executed at time **tj**, the base rate spikes depending on the
redeemed amount **m** relative to the current BOLD supply **n** according to the following

formula:


**b(tj) = b(tj-1) + α * m / n**


where **α** is a constant spike parameter set to 1.


19


The resulting fee **f(tj) = fmin + b(tj)** is already applied to the redemption causing the spike.

### Critical threshold and collateral shutdown


The protocol aims to protect each borrow market from ever becoming undercollateralized in
case of a collapsing collateral asset. It does so by throttling debt creation and collateral
withdrawal in unhealthy markets and by shutting down the entire market as an ultima ratio.


To that end, the protocol incorporates two safety thresholds for the system’s Total
Collateralization Ratio (TCR), using different thresholds for ETH and the LSTs:


   Critical Threshold (CT)

   Shutdown Threshold (ST)


If the TCR of a borrow market falls below the respective CT (150% for ETH and 160% for
wstETH and rETH), creation of new debt in the affected market is prohibited. Collateral
withdrawal is allowed as long as it goes along with a debt repayment greater than or equal to
the collateral withdrawn (i.e., as long as it’s overall improving both individual CR and TCR).
In the meantime, borrowers can still repay debt or top up their collateral. Unlike in Liquity
V1’s Recovery Mode, the liquidation threshold (maximum LTV) for individual Troves remains
unchanged though, avoiding unnecessary liquidation of innocent borrowers [24] .


If the TCR drops below the ST (110% for ETH and 120% for wstETH and rETH) or in case of
an oracle failure [25], the protocol triggers the shutdown of the respective borrow market and
permanently disables all borrowing operations except for closing Troves. Upon triggering a
collateral shutdown, the protocol enables and encourages single-collateral redemptions [26],
aimed at repaying the entire debt of the affected market as soon as possible. For that matter,
users are allowed to redeem BOLD against the respective collateral at a more favorable
exchange rate than the current oracle price of the LST, replacing the usual redemption fee
by a positive discount of 2%. As long as BOLD isn’t trading significantly above peg,
arbitrageurs are thus incentivized to redeem all BOLD from the unhealthy borrow market [27]

until its debt collapses to 0.


Despite these extra incentives, there’s no guarantee that the system will be able to
successfully clear the entire debt backed by the respective collateral if its value has dropped
extremely or keeps dropping too fast. In the worst case scenario, the system may end up
with a portion of its BOLD supply becoming unbacked by debt.


24 As well as avoiding a number of potential edge cases and attack surfaces where the system is
pulled into a state with TCR < CT.

25 Either the call to the oracle reverts, or returns 0, or returns a price that is too stale.

26 Besides that, regular redemptions and liquidations remain possible.

27 Note the incentive might disappear when BOLD is trading significantly above peg.
