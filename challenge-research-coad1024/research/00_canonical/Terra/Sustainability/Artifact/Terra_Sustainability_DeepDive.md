## Abstract

This paper provides a structural economic analysis of Terra's UST/LUNA collapse in May 2022, demonstrating that the failure was mechanistically inevitable rather than circumstantial. We apply the hybrid Stablecoin LEGO framework ([Liu et al., 2025](#ref-lego-sok)) to show that Terra's design contained a fatal reflexivity loop: the stabilization mechanism amplified stress rather than absorbing it. By the time confidence broke, no quantity of exogenous reserves could have prevented hyperinflation. We argue that Terra represents the canonical failure mode of pure seigniorage stablecoins and provides essential lessons for mechanism design in decentralized finance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Critical Lens:** This analysis challenges the post-hoc narrative that Terra failed due to a "coordinated attack." We demonstrate that the protocol was structurally insolvent months before the collapse, and that the attack merely revealed—rather than caused—this insolvency.

## 1. Introduction: The Sustainability Paradox

Terra presented a compelling vision: a decentralized stablecoin backed by nothing but market confidence and algorithmic arbitrage. At its peak, UST commanded \$18 billion in circulation and LUNA exceeded \$40 billion in market capitalization ([Richmond Fed, 2022](#ref-richmondfed)). Yet within 72 hours in May 2022, the entire ecosystem collapsed to effectively zero.

The conventional explanation—a "bank run" triggered by malicious actors—obscures the deeper structural truth. Terra was not killed by an attack; it was killed by its own design. The stabilization mechanism that enabled its growth became the engine of its destruction.

*Figure 1: The Death Spiral Mechanism. Once redemptions exceed market absorption capacity, each stabilization action amplifies stress rather than reducing it.*

This paper demonstrates three key findings:

1. **Structural Insolvency:** Terra's business model required continuous equity dilution, making collapse inevitable absent perpetual bull markets.
2. **Reflexivity Failure:** The stabilization gain (G) exceeded unity during stress, converting the mechanism from stabilizing to destabilizing.
3. **Operational Inadequacy:** Oracle latency, governance delay, and concentrated demand created multiple failure vectors that activated simultaneously.

## 2. The Business Model: Equity-Funded Yield Arbitrage

Terra's economic structure has been frequently mischaracterized as a "dual-token seigniorage system." A more accurate description is **equity-funded yield arbitrage**: the protocol subsidized unsustainable deposit rates by continuously selling equity (LUNA) to the market.

### 2.1 The Anchor Dependency

The growth of UST was almost entirely driven by Anchor Protocol, which offered ~20% APY on UST deposits. At its peak, Anchor held approximately $16 billion—representing **72% of total UST demand** ([NBER, 2023](#ref-nber)). This concentration created a single point of failure: when Anchor's yield became unsustainable, UST demand would collapse instantaneously.

![Anchor Protocol Unsustainable Economics](../diagrams/terra_anchor_imbalance.png)
*Figure 2: Anchor's deposit/borrow imbalance. The protocol paid 20% on \$16B while earning 12% on \$3B, creating a \$13 billion structural deficit.*

The arithmetic was unforgiving. Anchor's yield reserve—the pool subsidizing the rate differential—depleted at approximately \$6 million daily ([Richmond Fed, 2022](#ref-richmondfed)). By early 2022, this required a $450 million injection from the Luna Foundation Guard. The subsidy was not a bridge to sustainability; it was oxygen for a patient on terminal life support.

### 2.2 Net Interest Margin: Structurally Negative

Applying conventional banking metrics reveals Terra's insolvency:

$$\text{NIM} = \text{Yield}_{\text{Assets}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Liabilities}}$$

For Anchor:

- **Asset Yield:** 12% on ~$3B borrows = ~\$360M/year
- **Liability Cost:** 20% on ~$16B deposits = ~\$3.2B/year
- **Net Interest Margin:** **-8% to -10%**

A protocol cannot survive negative carry indefinitely. Unlike traditional banks that can access central bank liquidity during stress, Terra had no lender of last resort. The Luna Foundation Guard's Bitcoin reserves—often cited as a "backstop"—amounted to \$1.5B against \$18B in liabilities: coverage of just 8% ([Richmond Fed, 2022](#ref-richmondfed)).

## 3. Reflexivity Analysis: The Mathematics of Collapse

The core innovation of Terra's design—burning UST to mint LUNA during redemption—contained a fatal mathematical flaw. Under stress, this mechanism exhibits positive feedback: redemptions cause LUNA inflation, which depresses LUNA price, which reduces backing ratio, which triggers more redemptions.

We formalize this through the **Reflexivity Gain (G)**:

$$G = \frac{\Delta \text{LUNA Supply}}{\Delta \text{UST Redeemed}} \times \frac{\Delta \text{LUNA Price}}{\Delta \text{LUNA Supply}}$$

When G < 1, redemptions are absorbed by the market, and the system stabilizes. When G > 1, each redemption creates more value destruction than it absorbs, initiating an irreversible death spiral ([Klages-Mundt, 2022](#ref-klages)).

Empirical observation during the collapse shows G exceeding 5 during the acute phase (May 9-10) and approaching infinity during terminal hyperinflation (May 11-13). At this point, mathematical certainty dictated that no quantity of exogenous reserves could halt the spiral—the mechanism itself had become the enemy.

## 4. The 72-Hour Collapse: Chronological Analysis

The collapse of Terra occurred in distinct phases, each characterized by the activation of a different failure vector.

![Terra UST 72-Hour Collapse Timeline](../diagrams/terra_timeline_collapse.png)
*Figure 3: The 72-hour collapse timeline. Key failure vectors activated sequentially: liquidity (May 7), reflexivity (May 9), oracle exploitation (May 10), governance failure (May 11).*

**Phase 1: Liquidity Shock (May 7)**
Large withdrawals from Anchor triggered imbalances in the Curve 3Pool, pushing UST composition to 85% ([NBER, 2023](#ref-nber)). This signaled concentrated selling pressure and began the confidence unraveling.

**Phase 2: Defense Deployment (May 8)**
The Luna Foundation Guard deployed \$1.5 billion in Bitcoin to defend the peg. UST briefly recovered to \$0.99, creating false confidence that the crisis was contained.

**Phase 3: Reflexivity Activation (May 9-10)**
UST broke below $0.98, triggering mass redemptions. The mint/burn mechanism activated at scale, inflating LUNA supply by orders of magnitude ([Richmond Fed, 2022](#ref-richmondfed)). G crossed 1.0 and the death spiral became self-sustaining ([Klages-Mundt, 2022](#ref-klages)).

**Phase 4: Oracle Exploitation (May 10)**
As LUNA crashed 50% on centralized exchanges, the on-chain oracle lagged by 30+ seconds. Arbitrageurs exploited this window to mint UST at stale prices, extracting over $100 million in value and accelerating insolvency ([Chainalysis, 2022](#ref-chainalysis)).

**Phase 5: Governance Paralysis (May 11-18)**
The chain halted twice. Emergency Proposal 1164 was created on May 11 but did not pass until May 18—five days after the collapse was complete ([NBER, 2023](#ref-nber)). Standard governance mechanisms proved catastrophically inadequate for crisis response.

## 5. Counterfactual Analysis: Could Terra Have Survived?

Post-mortem analysis often asks whether different design choices could have saved Terra. We evaluate the primary candidates:

**Larger Reserves:** The Luna Foundation Guard held \$3 billion at peak. Simulations suggest that even \$10 billion would have been insufficient given G > 1. The problem was not reserve quantity but mechanism design.

**Circuit Breakers:** Automatic redemption halts when oracle bias exceeds 5% could have prevented the "infinite money glitch." However, this would have merely converted a hyperinflationary collapse into a peg break with frozen exits—a different failure mode, not prevention.

**Demand Diversification:** Reducing Anchor concentration below 30% of UST demand would have eliminated the single point of failure. This was mechanistically possible but economically challenging: without Anchor's unsustainable yield, UST offered no competitive advantage over USDC.

**Governance Speed:** Sub-hour emergency response capability was technically achievable through multisig override mechanisms. Implementation would have required sacrificing decentralization—the same tradeoff Sky/MakerDAO has accepted with its RWA transition.

The uncomfortable conclusion is that Terra's design contained internal contradictions that could not be resolved without fundamental restructuring into something no longer recognizable as an "algorithmic stablecoin."

## 6. Simulation-Validated Stabilization Strategies

Recent simulation research by [Calandra et al. (2024)](#ref-calandra) provides quantitative evidence for stabilization mechanisms that could have significantly reduced Terra's collapse severity. Using a custom Matlab-based simulation environment that replicates the May 2022 conditions, the authors tested four stabilization strategies with improvements ranging from **60.6% to 95.8%** in preventing collapse events.

### 6.1 Algorithmic Defenses

**Strategy 1: Panic Zone Circuit Breakers**
Unlike the simple circuit breakers discussed in Section 5, Calandra et al. propose a *graduated* intervention system:

- **Panic Zone Detection:** When UST depeg exceeds a threshold (e.g., 2%), the system enters "panic mode"
- **Redemption Caps:** UST→LUNA burns are rate-limited rather than fully halted, preventing cascade failures while allowing gradual exits
- **Virtual Liquidity Pool (VLP) Auto-Replenishment:** The imbalance parameter δ adjusts automatically to maintain composite price stability

**Strategy 2: LUNA Minting Caps**
To prevent the reflexivity gain G from approaching infinity:

- **Per-Block Issuance Limits:** Hard cap on LUNA minted per block during hyperinflation events
- **Supply Velocity Monitoring:** Automatic tightening when supply growth exceeds safe thresholds
- **Result:** Prevents the terminal hyperinflation phase that destroyed LUNA's value

### 6.2 Hybrid Approaches: Partial Collateralization

**Strategy 3: USDT Reserve Pool**
A protocol-controlled USDT reserve provides automatic peg restoration:

- **Market Buybacks:** When UST depegs, the protocol deploys USDT reserves to purchase UST on open markets
- **Collateralization Ratio:** Dynamic adjustment based on stress indicators (unlike LFG's static 8% coverage)
- **Result:** Up to **95.8% improvement** in preventing collapse—the most effective strategy tested

**Strategy 4: BTC Reserve Pool**
Addressing the fundamental flaw identified previously—that endogenous backstops are illusory:

- **Exogenous Absorption:** BTC reserves absorb excess LUNA minting, breaking the reflexivity loop
- **Automatic Deployment:** Triggered by supply velocity metrics rather than governance votes
- **Key Difference from LFG:** Systematic rules-based deployment vs. discretionary emergency measures

### 6.3 Comparative Results

| Strategy | Type | Collapse Reduction | Mechanism |
|----------|------|-------------------|----------|
| Circuit Breakers | Algorithmic | 60.6% | Rate-limited redemptions |
| Minting Caps | Algorithmic | Prevents G→∞ | Supply velocity control |
| USDT Reserve | Hybrid | **95.8%** | Peg restoration via buybacks |
| BTC Reserve | Hybrid | Significant | Exogenous LUNA absorption |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The simulation results validate our Section 3 analysis: **hybrid approaches outperform pure algorithmic solutions**. The most effective strategy (USDT reserve pool) achieves near-complete collapse prevention by introducing genuine exogenous backing—fundamentally transforming the system from "algorithmic" to "partially collateralized."

### 6.4 Implications

The Calandra et al. findings resolve the apparent contradiction in Section 5: Terra *could* have survived, but only by abandoning its core value proposition. The 95.8% improvement from USDT collateralization is effectively an admission that seigniorage stablecoins require external reserves to function under stress—negating the capital efficiency argument that justified their existence.

## 7. Implications for Mechanism Design

Terra's failure provides essential lessons for the broader stablecoin ecosystem:

**Lesson 1: Endogenous Backstops Are Illusory.** Any stabilization mechanism that mints the system's own equity to absorb losses will exhibit G > 1 under sufficient stress ([Klages-Mundt, 2022](#ref-klages)). Only exogenous reserves provide true solvency protection.

**Lesson 2: Demand Concentration Is Existential Risk.** Single-protocol dependency creates fragility that cannot be mitigated by reserves or mechanisms. Diversification is a prerequisite for resilience.

**Lesson 3: Oracle Latency Enables Extraction.** In high-volatility environments, oracle update frequency must scale with price velocity ([Chainalysis, 2022](#ref-chainalysis)). Fixed-interval oracles create predictable arbitrage windows.

**Lesson 4: Governance Cannot Outpace Markets.** Standard DAO voting procedures operate on timescales incompatible with financial crises. Emergency response requires pre-authorized automated mechanisms.

## 8. Conclusion: The Canonical Failure Mode

Terra represents the canonical failure mode of pure algorithmic stablecoins. Its collapse was not a black swan but the deterministic outcome of a system designed to work only in bull markets. The same mechanism that enabled growth—burning LUNA to mint UST—became the engine of destruction when confidence reversed.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Structural Insolvency:** Terra operated with -8% NIM, requiring continuous equity dilution to survive.
2. **Fatal Reflexivity:** The stabilization mechanism exhibited G >> 1 under stress, making collapse self-accelerating.
3. **Operational Fragility:** Oracle latency, governance delay, and demand concentration created multiple simultaneous failure vectors.

**Final Verdict:** Terra did not fail because of an attack. It failed because algorithmic seigniorage stablecoins contain an irreducible design flaw: the backstop must be exogenous to provide true protection, but exogenous backstops negate the claimed capital efficiency. There is no escape from this contradiction.
